OAuth.io - Node.js SDK
======================

OAuth that just works !
This SDK eases the integration of OAuth.io's services on a Node.js backend.

Features
--------

- Server-side OAuth authentication flow
- Requests to API from the backend, including the unified "me" method
- Unified user information requests for available providers from the backend
- Access token renewal with the refresh_token when available

With this SDK, your OAuth flow is also more secure as the oauth token never
leaves your backend.

Installation
------------

To install the SDK, run the following command in the folder of your Nodejs app :

```bash
myapp/folder$ npm install oauthio --save
```

Whenever you need to use the SDK, you can require it from one of your modules like this :

```JavaScript
var OAuth = require('oauthio');
```

To use this SDK, you need to create an account (if you don't have one yet) on [oauth.io](https://oauth.io), create an app in the [Dashboard](https://oauth.io/dashboard) and add a provider to that app.

You'll have to go on the provider's website to register a new app, and copy its keys on oauth.io. **Don't forget to select the Node.js backend on OAuth.io.**

Initializing the SDK
--------------------

Initialize the SDK with your OAuth.io's app's key and secret. You can get these pieces of information from the [Dashboard][2] in oauth.io.

You can call the initialize method right after you initialized your express/restify app and included your middlewares :

```JavaScript
OAuth.initialize('your_app_key', 'your_app_secret');
```

Basic usage
-----------

To authorize your user to one of the 100+ provider of OAuth.io, you need to define 2 endpoints.

The first endpoint is used to redirect your user on the authorization page of the chosen provider. The second one is used as a callback when your user is authorized or when your user canceled the demand of authorization.

```JavaScript
app.get('/signin', oauth.auth(provider_name, url_to_redirect));
```

* `provider_name` is the provider that your user has to connect with (e.g. `twitter`, `facebook`, `google` or 100+ others).

* `url_to_redirect` is the full url of your callback endpoint (e.g. `http://your-website.com/oauth/redirect`)

Once your user has authorized or canceled the authorization, he is redirected on the `url_to_redirect`, you can define this endpoint like this:

```Javascript
app.get('/oauth/redirect', oauth.redirect(function(result, req, res) {
    //todo with result
}));
```

Then, you can use `result` to make API call to the provider easily using `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `del()` or `me()` method.

Take a look to this complete example using twitter API

```Javascript
app.get('/signin', oauth.auth('twitter', 'http://localhost:8080/oauth/redirect'));

app.get('/oauth/redirect', oauth.redirect(function(result, req, res) {
    if (result instanceof Error) {
        res.send(500, "error: " + result.message);
        return;
    }
    result.me().done(function(me) {
        console.log(me);
        res.send(200, JSON.stringify(me));
    });
}));

```

Auth method
-----------

The SDK gives you an `auth` method that allows you to retrieve a `request_object`. That `request_object` allows you to make API calls, and contains the access token.

The `auth` method takes :

1. a provider name
2. the session array
3. (optional) an options object

It returns a promise to let you handle the callback and error management.

```
OAuth.auth('provider', req.session, {
    option_field: option_value,
    //...
});
```

The options object can contain the following fields :

- code: an OAuth code, that will be used to get credentials from the provider and build a request_object
- credentials: a credentials object, that will be used to rebuild a refreshed request_object
- force_refresh: forces the credentials refresh if a refresh token is available

If nothing is given in the options object, the auth method tries to build a request_object from the session.

**Authenticating the user from the frontend JS SDK**

When you launch the authentication flow from the front-end (that is to say when you show a popup to the user so that he can allow your app to use his/her data), you'll be given a code (see next section, "Integrating the front-end SDK" to learn how to get the code).

You'll have to give this code to your backend, so that it can retrieve an access token from oauth.io.

To do that, you have to create an authentication endpoint on your backend. This endpoint will make the access token request to oauth.io. You can use the same endpoint to perform local login/subscribe actions too.

```JavaScript
app.post('/api/signin', function (req, res) {
    var code = JSON.parse(req.body).code;

    // Here the auth method takes the field 'code'
    // in its options object. It will thus use that code
    // to retrieve credentials from the provider.
    OAuth.auth('facebook', req.session, {
        code: code
    })
    .then(function (request_object) {
        // request_object contains the access_token if OAuth 2.0
        // or the couple oauth_token,oauth_token_secret if OAuth 1.0
        
        // request_object also contains methods get|post|patch|put|delete|me
        return request_object.get('/me');
    })
    .then(function (info) {
        var user = {
            email: info.email,
            firstname: info.first_name,
            lastname: info.last_name
        };
        //login your user here.
        res.send(200, 'Successfully logged in');
    })
    .fail(function (e) {
        //handle errors here
        res.send(400, 'An error occured');
    });
});
```

**Authenticating a user from the session**

Once a user is authenticaded on a service, the credentials are stored
in the session. You can access it very easily from any other endpoint to use it. Let's say for example that you want to post something on your user's wall on Facebook :

```JavaScript
app.post('/api/wall_message', function (req, res){
    var data = JSON.parse(req.body);
    //data contains field "message", containing the message to post
    
    OAuth.auth('facebook', req.session)
        .then(function (request_object) {
            return request_object.post('/me/feed', {
                message: data.message
            });
        })
        .then(function (r) {
            //r contains Facebook's response, normaly an id
            if (r.id)
                res.send(200, 'Successfully posted message');
            else
                res.send(400, 'An error occured while posting the message');
        })
        .fail(function (e) {
            res.send(400, 'An error occured while posting the message');
        });
});
```

**Authenticating a user from saved credentials**

* Saving credentials
If you want to save the credentials to use them when the user is offline, (e.g. in a cron loading information), you can save the credentials in the data storage of your choice. All you need to do is to retrieve the credentials object from the request_object : 

```javascript
OAuth.auth('provider', req.session, {
    code: code
})
    .then(function (request_object) {
        var credentials = request_object->getCredentials();

        // Here you can save the credentials object wherever you want

    });
```

* Using saved credentials

You can then rebuild a request_object from the credentials you saved earlier :
```javascript
// Here you retrieved the credentials object from your data storage

OAuth.auth('provider', req.session, {
    credentials: credentials
})
    .then(function (request_object) {
        // Here request_object has been rebuilt from the credentials object
        // If the credentials are expired and contain a refresh token,
        // the auth method automatically refresh them.
    });

```

**Refreshing saved credentials**

Tokens are automatically refreshed when you use the `auth` method with the session or with saved credentials. The SDK checks that the access token is expired whenever it's called.

If it is, and if a refresh token is available in the credentials (you may have to configure the OAuth.io app in a specific way for some providers), it automatically calls the OAuth.io refresh token endpoint.

If you want to force a refresh from the `auth` method, you can pass the `force_refresh` field in the option object, like this :

```javascript
OAuth.auth('provider', req.session, {
    force_refresh: true
});
```

You can also refresh a credentials object manually. To do that, call the OAuth.refreshCredentials on the request_object or on a credentials object :

```javascript
OAuth.refreshCredentials(request_object, req.session)
    .then(function (request_object) {
        // Here request_object has been refreshed
    })
    .fail(function (e) {
        // Handle an error
    });
```

Detailed documentation
----------------------

This part lists and describes all the available methods in this SDK.

**OAuth object**

Available methods :

*Version information*

```JavaScript
OAuth.getVersion();
```

Returns the version of the SDK.

*Initialization*

```JavaScript
OAuth.initialize('app_key', 'app_secret');
```

Initializes the SDK by storing your app key and secret inside its cache.

*State token generation*
```JavaScript
var token = OAuth.generateStateToken(req);
```
Returns a token and stores it in the session.

*Authentication*

```JavaScript
var promise = OAuth.auth(code, req);
```

Retrieves the access token from oauth.io by sending the code, which was sent by the front-end.

Returns a promise, that you can use like this :

```JavaScript
promise.then(success_callback).fail(error_callback);
```

`success_callback` takes the authentication object as argument, `error_callback` takes an error as argument.

*Getting a user's authentication object for a given provider*

```JavaScript
var authentication_object = OAuth.create(req, 'provider_name')
```

This returns an authentication object for the current user and the given provider.

**Authentication object**

The authentication object refers to what is returned by the `auth` and `create` methods.

It contains the following :

```Javascript
auth_obj.access_token // if the provider implements OAuth 2.0
```

```Javascript
auth_obj.oauth_token // if the provider implements OAuth 1.0
auth_obj.oauth_token_secret // if the provider implements OAuth 1.0
```

```Javascript
auth_obj.expires_in //the number of seconds to token expiration
```

**Requests methods in the authentication object**

*get*

```Javascript
var promise = auth_obj.get(url);
```
Returns a promise, and performs a GET request to the API. Use the promise like this :

```Javascript
promise.then(function (r) {
    //r is the API's response
})
.fail(function (e) {
    //handle the error
});
```
*post*

```Javascript
var promise = auth_obj.post(url, data)
```

Returns a promise and performs a POST request to the API. You can add a body to the request as the second parameter (litteral object). Use the promise like this :

```Javascript
promise.then(function (r) {
    //r is the API's response
})
.fail(function (e) {
    //handle the error
});
```

*put*

```Javascript
var promise = auth_obj.put(url, data)
```

Returns a promise and performs a PUT request to the API. You can add a body to the request as the second parameter (litteral object). Use the promise like this :

```Javascript
promise.then(function (r) {
    //r is the API's response
})
.fail(function (e) {
    //handle the error
});
```

*patch*

```Javascript
var promise = auth_obj.patch(url, data)
```

Returns a promise and performs a PATCH request to the API. You can add a body to the request as the second parameter (litteral object). Use the promise like this :

```Javascript
promise.then(function (r) {
    //r is the API's response
})
.fail(function (e) {
    //handle the error
});
```

*del*

```Javascript
var promise = auth_obj.del(url, data)
```

Returns a promise and performs a DELETE request to the API.

```Javascript
promise.then(function (r) {
    //r is the API's response
})
.fail(function (e) {
    //handle the error
});
```

*me*

```Javascript
var promise = auth_obj.me(filter)
```

This method gets a unified object representing the user. The fields' format always remain the same, regardless of the provider, so that you can handle several providers in an easier way.

You can provide a filter, which is an array of strings, containing the different fields you need. For example :

```JavaScript
var filter = ['email', 'firstname', 'lastname'];
```

Use the returned promise like this :

```Javascript
promise.then(function (r) {
    //r is the API's response
})
.fail(function (e) {
    //handle the error
});
```

Please refer to [this page][4] to know which fields are available and for more information about OAuth.io's "me" feature.
